# Hello-World
Hello GitHub...
  I am currently in the process of teaching myself how to program in Python. Being self-taught I decided to learn Python first, as it is one of the easier languages to learn but, yet still powerful. Being passionate about computers and code Ive decided to persue this as a career. Hopefully, with practice, patience, and the drive that I have I will make this happen...
